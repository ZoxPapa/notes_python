<h1>Notes.python</h1>

<h5>This program is my verification work of python course.\
During this project I also try to repeat my knowledge at OOP. </h5>

This console program, which can work with notes: create, delete, edit etc.
To communicate with it user need to input digits at console. 

It's my first try to realise MVP pattern at Python language. \
So it's just nominally MVP. \
This program start from `main.py` file, then it start `View.py`, where we're communicating with the user. \
`View.py` uses methods of `Presenter.py` file. So it communicate with model, which name - `note.py`.
